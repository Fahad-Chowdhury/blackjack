# **Blackjack Game**
## About
Implementation of the popular game of Blackjack in command line using Python.
Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos. The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players are dealt two cards each and can choose to "hit" (take additional cards) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Face cards are worth 10, aces can be 1 or 11, and other cards are their face value. The player competes against the computer, aiming to have a higher hand value than the computer without going over 21.
